# Password_Keeper_React_Native

This is a successful attempt to create a crud + authentication + encryption program using React Native. The intitial goal was to create the app once in React Native and again in Xamarin to compare the development experience between the two. Sadly I have not gotten around to the Xamarin version yet. 

### Installation

Make sure you have NodeJS installed

Then make sure you have expo-cli installed

```bash
npm i -g expo-cli
```

Clone the respository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonmb626/Password_Keeper_React_Native.git
```
Change directory into the project and run it.

```bash
cd Password_Keeper_React_Native
npm start
```

This has currently only been tested on Android on a virtual machine.
